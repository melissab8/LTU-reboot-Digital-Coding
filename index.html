                This week we looked more at CSS and learnt about more of the CSS selectors, classes and IDs. We also looked at the specificity of CSS. We looked at inline and block elements and spans,  pseudo classes and also the how the CSS is read (cascading). We used more properties to decorate and style our HTML. Luke also taught us some useful shortcuts in VS code and showed us the shorthand for CSS for fonts.

                This week we learnt about the box model and how every element can be affected by padding, borders and margins. We also learnt about centering elements using margin auto. <br>
                In lesson 2.4 we started to learn about positioning and layout, including static, relative and absolute positioning. We created examples of the box model in task 2.3.4 and of relative positioning in task 2.4.3.

                This week was about Javascript fundamentals, we learnt it's history and uses. In development it can be added directly to the HTML using the script element tag or by linking to an external document (similar to a External css sheet) which is the recommended way. 
                We learnt that JS uses statements (the instructions for the browser) and the structure of the statements and we practised the 'console.log' and 'alert' statements. We also learnt how to comment out in JS too, which is the same as commenting out in css for multiple lines or // for commenting out single lines. 
                <br>
                We then went on to learn about variables, which is a named container which can be changed. Luke showed us how to 'declare' a variable and <em>initialising</em> the variable by adding a value. Without a value the variable is 'undefined'. The naming convention for declaring variables is to use camel case. 
                <br>
                The datatypes that can be used when adding a value to a variable are: 
                
                <ul>
                    <li>string</li>
                    <li>number</li>
                    <li>boolena</li>
                </ul>
