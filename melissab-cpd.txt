Reflection
 

// Your reflection goes here

In todays session we were introduced to Git/Github. We were shown VSCode text editor and the benefits of using this particular editor. We installed a few extensions (ES Linter, Live server and HTML snippets).
We also learned how to commit code to Git and push it up to the main branch on Github and understand the icons in Git (new file, deleted file, edited file)
