<p>When mouseover event, then show alert </p>
<button>Click here</button>

    // JS is declaring a variable to link it to the button tag (could use getElementByTag method but querySelector is just as easy). 
     var btn = document.querySelector("button");
    // Now i am using the btn variable and adding an event listener. I am selecting the mouseover event and including a function which says, if there is an event of mouseover show an alert (pop up) that says button clicked
      btn.addEventListener("mouseover", function( event ){

        alert("button clicked");
