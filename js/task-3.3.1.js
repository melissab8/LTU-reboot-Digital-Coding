function percentageCalculator(number, percentage) {
    var percentageOf = number / 100 * percentage;

}

console.log (percentageCalculator (300 , 10));


//You can write this directly in the browser console and you can change the values as you want.



//BODMAS you can do this in a different order to what i have done to get a % var could be (number * percentage) /100; my way above is much easier!
