//this is creating a variable with an array and then using a for loop to output this in the console.log


var favFoods = ["pizza", "Cheese", "chocolate","chips"];

for( var index = 0; index < favFoods.length; index++ ) {
   console.log( favFoods[index] );


}


/* If there was no 'for loop' then i would have to list it like:-

console.log( favFoods[0] );
console.log( favFoods[1] );
console.log( favFoods[2] );
console.log( favFoods[3] );
